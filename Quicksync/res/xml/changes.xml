	<package android:versionName="1.1.1" android:versionCode="37" versionDate="2011-04-01">
	^ Blank screen in Preferences activity during authentication after redirect from Twitter web site
	^ "Verify" preference moved to the top of the "User Credentials" preference's section,
		because User can really start from tapping it (typing Username is not required for OAuth)!
	</package>
	<package android:versionName="1.1.0" android:versionCode="36" versionDate="2011-03-12">
	# Fixed "black on black" tweet text on "Single tweet" window on Android v.2.3.3
	^ Style definitions in "res/values/themes.xml" reworked
	</package>
	<package android:versionName="1.0.5" android:versionCode="35" versionDate="2011-02-19">
	+ "Favorites" list added.
	+ Favorites are protected from automatic deletion (unlike other old tweets)
	+ Click on Widget opens the timeline, that has something new, in this order: messages, mentions, tweets
	^ Maximum History time (to store tweets) is 1 year now
	^ OAuth is On By Default.
	^ Mentions are not "quick Search" any more, they are just another type of "Timeline".
	  So we may search in Mentions also.
	^ "Automatic updates" setting is not being turned off by the System.
	(in beta1:)
	# Fixed issue: Old records are not being deleted
	</package>
